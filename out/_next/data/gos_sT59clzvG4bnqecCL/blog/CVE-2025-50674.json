The vulnerability (published as <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-50674\">CVE-2025-50674</a>) allows authenticated users to escalate privileges to root via a newline injection attack. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to change the root password, gaining complete system access and control over all data stored on the device.</p>\n<p>In this post, I'll show you how I found this vulnerability, explain the technical details of the flaw, and walk through the exploitation process. I'll also provide the vulnerable code and discuss why this represents a significant security risk.</p>\n<h2>Details of the Vulnerability</h2>\n<p>The vulnerability exists in the password change functionality of OpenMediaVault. The issue is located in the <code>changePassword()</code> method of the User class which fails to validate user input before writing it to a temporary file that is passed to the Linux <code>chpasswd</code> command.</p>\n<p>The vulnerable code is defined in <code>/usr/share/php/openmediavault/system/user.inc</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\"><code class=\"language-php\">public function changePassword($password) {\n    if (empty($password)) {\n        throw new \\OMV\\ValueException(\n            \"No password has been supplied for user '%s'.\",\n            $this->getName());\n    }\n    $tmpFile = new \\OMV\\System\\TmpFile();\n    $tmpFile->write(sprintf(\"%s:%s\", $this->getName(), $password));\n    $cmd = new \\OMV\\System\\Process(\"chpasswd\");\n    $cmd->setInputFromFile($tmpFile->getFilename());\n    $cmd->setRedirect2to1();\n    $cmd->execute();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's break down the code execution flow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The method receives a <code>$password</code> parameter from user input via the API</li>\n<li>It performs a simple check to ensure the password is not empty</li>\n<li>It creates a temporary file using the <code>TmpFile</code> class, which generates a unique random filename in <code>/tmp/</code></li>\n<li>It writes the string <code>username:password</code> to this file</li>\n<li>It creates a new <code>Process</code> object for the <code>chpasswd</code> Linux command</li>\n<li>It configures the process to take input from the temporary file</li>\n<li>It executes the command, which reads the temporary file and changes the password</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The problem is clear - the <code>$password</code> variable is not sanitized before being written to the temporary file. The function only checks if the password is empty, but doesn't validate its content. Since the Linux <code>chpasswd</code> command processes each line in the input file as a separate password change operation in the format <code>username:password</code>, an attacker can inject a newline character followed by \"root:newpassword\" into the password field to change the root password as well.</p>\n<h3>How chpasswd Works</h3>\n<p>The <code>chpasswd</code> command is a Linux utility that allows for batch password updates. It reads from standard input or a file, processing each line in the format <code>username:password</code>. Each line results in a password change for the specified user. The command is typically executed with root privileges, allowing it to modify any user's password in the system.</p>\n<p>When executed, <code>chpasswd</code> performs the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Reads each line from input</li>\n<li>Parses the line to extract username and password</li>\n<li>Uses PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) to update the user's password</li>\n<li>Updates the shadow file with the new password hash</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What makes this vulnerability particularly dangerous is that it allows a regular user to escalate privileges to root, giving complete control over the system with minimal effort.</p>\n<h2>Discovery Process</h2>\n<p>I discovered this vulnerability while performing security research on OpenMediaVault. After logging into the web interface with a regular user account, I began testing the password change functionality as this type of feature often processes sensitive information and interacts with system commands.</p>\n<p>Using Burp Suite to intercept and analyze the HTTP requests, I noticed that the password change request was sending the new password directly to the backend through an API endpoint. The API call structure was:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-none\"><code class=\"language-none\">POST /rpc.php HTTP/1.1\nHost: openmediavault.local\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\"service\":\"UserMgmt\",\"method\":\"setPasswordByContext\",\"params\":{\"password\":\"legitimatepassword\"}}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Looking at the source code (OpenMediaVault is open-source), I traced the API call flow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The request is processed by the API controller</li>\n<li>The controller validates the user session/authentication</li>\n<li>The user object is loaded with the specified username</li>\n<li>The <code>changePassword()</code> method is called with the password from the request</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Examining the <code>changePassword()</code> method, I immediately spotted the potential for newline injection due to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>No input validation on the password parameter</li>\n<li>Direct use of the password in a system command</li>\n<li>The use of <code>chpasswd</code> which processes input line-by-line</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The lack of input validation, combined with the use of the <code>chpasswd</code> command which processes input line by line, created the perfect conditions for a privilege escalation attack.</p>\n<h2>Technical Exploitation Details</h2>\n<h3>Newline Injection Mechanics</h3>\n<p>The exploitation leverages how the Linux <code>chpasswd</code> command processes its input file. When OpenMediaVault's password change function is called, it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Creates a temporary file with a name like <code>/tmp/omv_XXXXXX</code> where XXXXXX is a random string</li>\n<li>Writes <code>username:password</code> to the file</li>\n<li>Passes the file to the <code>chpasswd</code> command using its standard input</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The <code>chpasswd</code> command reads the file line by line, treating each line as a separate password change operation. By injecting a newline character into the password, we can add additional lines to be processed by <code>chpasswd</code>.</p>\n<h3>Privilege Escalation Mechanism</h3>\n<p>This vulnerability provides a direct privilege escalation path because any authenticated user can change the password of any other user, including root, by injecting a specially crafted payload. The attack works because:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The <code>changePassword()</code> method fails to validate the password content</li>\n<li>The <code>chpasswd</code> command processes each line in the input file as a separate operation</li>\n<li>The command runs with root privileges as part of the OpenMediaVault system processes</li>\n<li>No additional authorization check is performed within the <code>chpasswd</code> utility itself - it simply processes all lines from its input</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Payload Structure and Analysis</h3>\n<p>The malicious payload follows this structure:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-none\"><code class=\"language-none\">legitimatepassword\\nroot:maliciouspassword\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's analyze what happens when this payload is processed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The system creates a temporary file (e.g., <code>/tmp/omv_a1b2c3</code>)</li>\n<li>The payload is written to the file, resulting in the following content:\n<pre class=\"language-none\"><code class=\"language-none\">regular_user:legitimatepassword\nroot:maliciouspassword\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>The <code>chpasswd</code> command is executed with root privileges: <code>sudo chpasswd &#x3C; /tmp/omv_a1b2c3</code></li>\n<li>The command processes each line, changing:\n<ul>\n<li>The password for <code>regular_user</code> to <code>legitimatepassword</code></li>\n<li>The password for <code>root</code> to <code>maliciouspassword</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When processed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>legitimatepassword</code> becomes the new password for the original user</li>\n<li><code>root:maliciouspassword</code> creates a new entry that changes the root password to <code>maliciouspassword</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Exploitation Process Using Burp Suite</h2>\n<p>Here's a detailed step-by-step guide to exploiting the vulnerability:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I logged into OpenMediaVault with a regular user account</li>\n<li>Navigated to the password change functionality in the web interface</li>\n<li>Started a password change request for my user account</li>\n<li>Intercepted the request with Burp Suite's proxy</li>\n<li>Modified the password parameter to include a newline injection:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre class=\"language-none\"><code class=\"language-none\">POST /api/v1/user/password HTTP/1.1\nHost: openmediavault.local\nContent-Type: application/json\nCookie: OMV_AUTH=abcdef123456\n\n{\n  \"username\": \"regular_user\",\n  \"password\": \"legitimatepassword\\nroot:EvilRootPass\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The injection works because the JSON parser in PHP correctly interprets the escaped newline character (<code>\\n</code>) as an actual newline in the resulting string.</p>\n<p>When sent, the request successfully changed both the regular user's password and the root password. I confirmed the exploit worked by:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Verifying my regular user account's password had changed to \"legitimatepassword\"</li>\n<li>Attempting to log in via SSH as root using \"EvilRootPass\"</li>\n<li>Examining the system logs which showed two password change events</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Real-World Attack Scenario</h2>\n<p>In a real attack, an adversary would:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Gain initial access to OpenMediaVault with a regular user account (through legitimate access, credential stuffing, or social engineering)</li>\n<li>Use the privilege escalation vulnerability to change the root password</li>\n<li>Log in as root and gain complete control over the storage device</li>\n<li>Access all data stored on the NAS</li>\n<li>Install persistent backdoors</li>\n<li>Potentially pivot to other systems on the network</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This vulnerability is particularly concerning for internet-exposed OpenMediaVault instances, as attackers could gain full control of the storage system and all its data with minimal effort after obtaining any user-level account.</p>\n<h2>Mitigation</h2>\n<p>To fix this vulnerability, proper input validation needs to be implemented in the <code>changePassword()</code> method. A simple solution is to reject passwords containing newline characters:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\"><code class=\"language-php\">// Validate password - reject if it contains newlines\nif (preg_match('/[\\r\\n]/', $password)) {\n    throw new \\OMV\\ValueException(\n        \"Password contains invalid characters for user '%s'.\",\n        $this->getName());\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The OpenMediaVault team has addressed this vulnerability in newer versions by implementing proper input validation to prevent newline injections.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This vulnerability in OpenMediaVault demonstrates how seemingly small validation oversights can lead to critical security issues. The combination of unsanitized user input and interaction with system commands created a perfect storm for privilege escalation.</p>\n<p>What makes this vulnerability particularly interesting is that it follows a classic pattern of injection attacks, yet it was overlooked during development and code review. It serves as a reminder that basic input validation is critical, especially when handling sensitive operations like password changes.</p>\n<p>From a defensive perspective, the key lessons are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Always validate all user input, especially when used in system commands</li>\n<li>Follow the principle of least privilege for system operations</li>\n<li>Use secure APIs instead of shell commands whenever possible</li>\n<li>Implement proper authorization checks for sensitive functions</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep your OpenMediaVault installations updated, and consider implementing network segmentation to limit access to these devices, especially from untrusted networks. Regular security audits of even trusted open-source software are essential to identify these types of vulnerabilities before attackers do.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-50674\">CVE-2025-50674</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openmediavault/openmediavault/commit/e95e9f3a73ed1abd5f3728a7f4424d56821b9e65\">Improve validation of RPCs that contain passwords (the fix)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openmediavault/openmediavault\">OpenMediaVault GitHub Repository</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html\">MITRE CWE-20: Improper Input Validation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/269.html\">MITRE CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html\">OWASP Input Validation Cheat Sheet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/chpasswd.8.html\">Linux chpasswd Command Manual</a></li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"Recently, I discovered a critical vulnerability in OpenMediaVault, a popular open-source network-attached storage solution.
